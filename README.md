## Redux Legacy Code

This project is a test project to check how to use legacy code of Redux. 
It is an attempt to learn how the Redux worked previously and **basic concepts**

You will learn:
- **How to create a store**
- **How to create reducer functions**
- **How to create actions**
- **How to add all of then to your app.js file**

I have used minimum code and minimum syntax to create a basic counter app. 
If you want to use this file. clone the project, update and commit it.
